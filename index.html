        <h1>Quad Tree Demo</h1>
        <p>The quad tree (QT) is essentially a set of keys paired with values,
            where every key is a unique point, and every value is non-null,
            along with an axis-aligned bounding box (AABB).
            The AABB defines the area which the QT can observe.
            Any attempt to insert a key not in the AABB is rejected.
            Any attempt to insert a duplicate key is rejected.
            Any attempt to inset a non-null value is rejected.
            You can find a value by a specific key,
            or find multiple values by an AABB.
            You can also remove values by their key,
            or clear the entire QT.
        </p>
        <p>This demo animates particles with a circular boundary in the canvas.
            The particles consist of a position vector and velocity vector,
            and are stored in an array for iterating over easily.
            They are also stored in a QT to compare against close neighbors for collisions.
            This demo removes any objects that have a duplicate key (i.e., occupy the same position).
        </p>
        <p>To interact with the demo, you can click anywhere on the canvas
            to spawn a new particle which moves in a random direction.
            There is also a button labelled "Explode" which, when clicked,
            will place a large number of particles in a circle on the canvas, moving outwards.
            The button labelled "Pause" or "Play" simply stops or starts the animation.
            The button labelled "Clear" resets the array of particles and the QT.
            Once a particle hits an edge of the canvas, it bounces off in the opposite direction.
            The gridlines of the QT are drawn in green,
            and all particles are drawn in blue,
            with the exception of particles which have collided, which are drawn in red.
