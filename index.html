      <h1>Quad Tree Demo</h1>
      <p>The quad tree (QT) is essentially a set of keys paired with values and an
        axis-aligned bounding box (AABB), where every key is a unique point.  The
        AABB defines the area which the QT can observe.  Any attempt to insert a
        key not in the AABB is rejected.  Any attempt to insert a duplicate key is
        rejected.  You can find a value by a specific key, or find multiple values
        by an AABB.  You can also remove values by their key, or clear the entire
        QT.
      </p>
      <p>This demo animates particles with a circular boundary in the canvas.  The
        particles consist of a position vector and velocity vector.  They are
        stored in a QT to compare against close neighbors for collisions.  This
        demo handles any objects that have a duplicate key (i.e., occupy the same
        position) by storing them in an array.  Note that the more objects that
        occupy the same position will drastically slow down the simulation.
      </p>
      <p>To interact with the demo, you can click anywhere on the canvas to spawn
        a new particle which moves in a random direction.  There is also a button
        labelled "Explode" which, when clicked, will place a large number of
        particles in a circle on the canvas, moving outwards.  The button labelled
        "Pause" or "Play" simply stops or starts the animation.  The button
        labelled "Clear" resets the QT of particles.  Once a particle hits an edge
        of the canvas, it bounces off in the opposite direction.  The gridlines of
        the QT are drawn in green, and all particles are drawn in blue, with the
        exception of particles which have collided, which are drawn in red.
